## 4. Market Dynamics

### Recent Competitive Moves
- Dec 2023: Urban Sports Club raised ~€95M in new funding.
- 2024: Urban Sports Club expanded its partner network by ~43%.
- Jan 2026: Urban Sports Club increased web traffic by ~50% via programmatic campaigns.
- 2024–2025: ClassPass expanded its corporate wellness partnerships.

### Emerging Competitors
- **FITPASS (India):** Low-cost regional aggregator in India, proving the model in emerging markets.
- **Regional EU aggregators:** Single-city or single-country platforms focusing on specific niches or geographies.
- **Traditional gym alliances:** Chains forming reciprocal access agreements instead of building full platforms.

### Consolidation & M&A Activity
- Corporate wellness platforms expected to consolidate as scale requirements increase.
- Traditional gym chains increasingly partnering with aggregators rather than building their own tech.
- VC funding concentrating on leaders like Urban Sports Club and Gympass, making fundraising harder for smaller entrants.

## 5. Differentiation Opportunities

### Where We Win
1. **Community-first studio partnerships:** MoveAtlas positions itself as a long-term growth partner for studios, not just a lead generator.
2. **Transparent, simple pricing:** No credits or hidden conditions; radical transparency is a core brand value.
3. **SME-accessible corporate wellness:** Designed to be easy to adopt and afford for companies too small for enterprise-focused solutions.

### Where We Lose (and Why)
1. **Network scale:** MoveAtlas offers fewer venues and markets than Urban Sports Club or ClassPass, so "max selection" users may choose incumbents.
2. **Brand awareness:** As a newer entrant, MoveAtlas lacks the recognition and social proof of long-established brands.

### Uncontested Space
- **Community-driven aggregation:** No major competitor optimizes for studio health and member community over pure network size.
- **SME-focused wellness:** There is a clear gap between enterprise offerings and SME-ready solutions.
- **Inclusive, anti-gatekeeping positioning:** MoveAtlas can own a more accessible and non-elitist framing of boutique fitness.
